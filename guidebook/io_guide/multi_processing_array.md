The Multi Processing Array is a multiblock machine that allows you to run almost any multiblocks recipes in batches,
depending on the size of the machine.

It is a great way to speed up your production, especially for large recipes that take a long time to process. Or to save
space in your factory by combining multiple machines into one.
