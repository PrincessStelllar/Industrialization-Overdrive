<Recipe id="industrialization_overdrive:machines/pyrolyse_oven/craft" />

The Pyrolyse oven is an upgrade to the [**Coke Oven**](../steam_age/coke_oven.md) which runs on electricity instead of
steam.

It is capable of processing the same recipes as the Coke Oven, but it can also overclock which allows it to run much
faster,

and if that wasn't enough, it can also process multiple of the same recipe at once(known as batch crafting), depending
on the coils used to build it.

Oh, and it can also process wood into charcoal at a 4:5 ratio, with creosote as a by-product, which is a nice bonus.
